# Frontend Messenger Application

Welcome to my first project. This work is the final challenge of Geekshubs Academy LevelUp bootcamp.



## Goals 🎯
* Putting into practice the basics of HTML, Javascript and CSS of a frontend application using methods, objects, reusing functions, etc.
* Gain experience with local and remote repositories workflow using git features like stashing, commits and branches.



## Description 🚀

The project consists in making the frontend for a chat application. 
The features are:
* Users can send text messages and the application registers and shows User, Date and Time they were sent.
* The messages get sorted by time and the messages stack can be scrolled up when it overflows the window.
* Users can create their own channels. The default channel is 'General'.
* When user select another channel, the message stack shows only the messages sent through that channel.
* Users can search elements through the 'search' field. When do it, only messages that contain the searched element are shown in the message stack, adding the channel info through they went sent. To go back to the message stack, simply select the desired channel again.
* As it has been only developed through the frontend, the data does not remain when the page is refreshed. Therefore the user cannot be selected, so it will default to 'John'.



## Built with 🛠️

* HTML5
* Javascript ES6
* CSS
